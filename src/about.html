          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, I am ! I am a third-year software engineering student with a
            deep interest in AI and web development. My journey into tech has
            been fueled by a passion for creating innovative solutions that
            blend functionality, efficiency, and user experience. Over the
            years, I have been building my expertise in modern web technologies,
            like React, and honing my Python skills, which are invaluable in AI
            development. I am also dedicated to mastering data structures and
            algorithms to enhance my problem-solving abilities. Whether it is
            designing intuitive web interfaces or developing intelligent
            systems, I am committed to continuous learning and growth. In
            addition to coding, I enjoy working on real-world projects that
            bring ideas to life. One of my recent ventures is a QR-code-based
            food ordering system, which merges convenience with technology.
            Looking forward, I aspire to create AI-powered applications that
            solve real-world challenges and have a positive impact on people's
            lives. When I am not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the
            latest tech trends, collaborating with like-minded individuals, or
            simply enjoying a good book or a walk outdoors. Since I want to
            improve my data structure and algorithm knowledge I applied to be
            part A2SV and I am waiting for their response. Thanks for stopping
            by my portfolio! Feel free to explore my work and get in touchâ€”I
            would love to connect and discuss exciting opportunities or ideas.
